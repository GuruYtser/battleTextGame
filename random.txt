Journal Prompt#1

How will people travel in the future? 4 sentence.
i think when you said travel, it's like time travel. i think probably the only key to travel in the future is time travel if they exist. i saw a video on youtube and there's a guy that they say time traveled just to see his wife. and when i saw that, i freaked out because he was all suspicious when the people saw him
looking at his sorroundings. and i think the police payed attention to this guy and went to police station just to know if what he's doing at that time, and i think he found his wife when he told it to the police?
